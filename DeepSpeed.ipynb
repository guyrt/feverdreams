I feel I have allowed this for too long, because regardless of what she says it just leads to more hurt later on.

       "My best friend since kindergarten and I were on a binge-drinking-kind of vacation to the Canary Islands a few years ago. We were about 19 at the time. We were in this trashy euro-disco club at about 4 am (the selection over there isn't great). I was pretty wasted, checking out a girl dancing alone. My friend is over at the bar getting beer, when a big burly guy grabs my shoulder from behind and walks me to a shady corner of the club. I'm not particularily well-built, weighing in around 65 kg at the time, and my friend's not much bigger. This guy was more stallone-esque. It turns out the girl I was looking at was his gf, and he owns the club. Two more even bigger guys (the guards) join us the corner. They don't speak english, I don't speak spanish, so I'm not gonna be able to talk myself out of this one. Looks like I'm going to be roughed up right? I'm all alone, cornered and desperation starts to set in. Suddenly the guys all back up a bit, and I notice that my friend has found me, and joined up right next to me giving the biggest evil eyes I've ever seen to these guys. They back off without any exchange of words, and we got out of there. My friend has never been in a fight and I'd never seen him angry before. But he sure had my back this time, and always have, before and after that, without me realizing it!\n",
