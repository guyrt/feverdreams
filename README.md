Idea stack:
~~Get it working~~
~~Modify to tell it to put a number on last line (and bump reward fxn)~~ (not needed!)
Modify the reward to reward last number seen?
    Right now, it's damn slow to figure out math b/c strugglign on format. Maybe worth helping it a bit?
    maybe even modify reward after a while to drop that part after a while? it's worth a shot.
    Do it in int_reward_func and make it fraction up to .5.
